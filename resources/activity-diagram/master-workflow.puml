title Corrected Workflow: EOM using Non-Destructive Status Tags

legend top
  <font size=14><b>Core Principle: Preserve the Academic Structure</b></font>
  --
  The system **NEVER** changes a student's assigned Cohort/Group/Section automatically.
  It applies a temporary **EOM Status Tag** (e.g., 'NeedsRetake', 'ReadyToAdvance')
  to a student's record for the purpose of this workflow only.

partition "Phase 1: EOM as a Tagging & Preparation Tool" {
    :Accesses EOM Dashboard for **Completed Module**;
    :Ingests final grades;

    |System|
    :Processes grades;
    :For each student, **applies an EOM Status Tag**:
      - 'ReadyToAdvance'
      - 'NeedsRetake'
      - 'RequiresReview' (for exceptions);
    note right
        This is a non-destructive **labeling** action.
        The student's formal Cohort/Group/Section
        assignment remains untouched.
