' --- The Initiating Dependency: Curriculum ---
database "Curriculum & Course Catalog" as R_Curriculum <<Resource>>
    PD --> R_Curriculum
    R_Curriculum --> Registrar
    note "Evidence (High): The entire schedule is based on a set of courses. While the actor 'PD' is an inference, the existence of this data as an input to the Registrar is a certainty." as E_Curriculum
    E_Curriculum --> R_Curriculum

' --- The Core Planning Loop (A Healthy, Sequential Dependency) ---
database "Staffing Needs" as R_Needs <<Resource>>
    Registrar --> R_Needs
    R_Needs --> coordinator
    note "Evidence (Very High): 'We need to find different faculties... it's a coordinated work between them and me...'" as E_Needs
    E_Needs --> R_Needs

database "Hired Faculty Data" as R_Hired <<Resource>>
    coordinator --> R_Hired
    R_Hired --> Registrar

' --- The Enrollment & Outcome Loop ---
rectangle "Student is Enrolled" as G_Enrolled <<Goal>>

' --- Data & Support Dependencies ---
database "Student Academic Data" as R_StudentData <<Resource>>
    SIS --> R_StudentData
    R_StudentData --> Registrar
    note "Evidence (Very High): Registrar uses student records from a central system for enrollment." as E_SIS

cloud "Enrollment Issues Resolved" as SG_Issues <<Softgoal>>
    actor "Student Services" as SS
    Student --> SG_Issues
    SG_Issues --> SS
    SS --> Registrar : (depends on for complex resolutions)
