\paragraph{Adaption of methodology} XP will be the main development methodology and will be supported by Scrum's Sprint, Sprint Review and Sprint planning.
The idea of the adoption is to have the testing approach and coding standards of extreme programming while working in timeboxes with defined workloads.
