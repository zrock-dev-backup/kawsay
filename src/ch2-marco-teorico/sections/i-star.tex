\subsection{i* Framework}
The i* framework \parencite{yu1995} is a modeling framework used in requirements engineering and software development.
It offers a way to model and analyze stakeholders' intentional relationships.
Intentional relationships are relationships that include actors, goals, tasks, resources, and social dependencies within an organizational context.
It assists in understanding the why behind system requirements and identifying potential trade-offs between different stakeholders' goals.

The framework is actor-oriented, meaning it uses the notion of \textit{actor} as a primitive concept.
Actors can be anything, from individuals to organizations, that have strategic interests and intentionality.
An actor's intentionality is captured through \textit{goals}.
A goal represents a condition or state of affairs that the actor wants to achieve.
Goals can be hard goals or soft goals.
Hard goals are precise and have clear criteria for satisfaction, while soft goals are less precise and represent desired qualities or considerations.

Table~\ref{tab:istarDependencyTypes} represents the dependency type along with its corresponding ontology.
\begin{table}
	\caption{Dependency types}\label{tab:istarDependencyTypes}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{} llX @{}}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Ontology} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Description} \\
		\midrule
		Entities & Resource & Used to represent the world as objects. \\
		Activities & Task & Produce a change in the world. \\
		Assertions & Goals & Expression of a condition or state in the world. \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Models}
The framework consists of two main models: the Strategic Dependency (SD) model and the Strategic Rationale (SR) model.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strategic Dependency (SD) Model:} This model shows the network of actors and their dependencies.
    It illustrates how actors depend on each other for goals, tasks, and resources.
    This model is useful for identifying critical dependencies and potential vulnerabilities in a system.
    \item \textbf{Strategic Rationale (SR) Model:} This model focuses on the internal rationale of actors, showing how their goals are achieved through tasks, and how these tasks utilize resources.
    It represents the reasons behind actor's actions and their intentional relationships.
    This model is used to explore alternative ways of achieving goals and understanding the trade-offs involved.
\end{itemize}
