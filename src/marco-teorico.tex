\section{Marco teorico}
% scheduling engine takes chaos and delivers order by obeying constraints
%
% > If a standard set of patterns is chosen, with compatible starting and ending times, schedules will fit together more easily. If patterns are dissimilar, more conflicts will occur within a given academic week.
%
% How can the effectiveness of the system be measured?
%
% scheduling conflicts, time patterns , courses and periods.

\subsection{Machine Learning}

As \textcite{mahesh2020machine} says, the capacity of a computer system to learn how to perform an specific task without being explicitly programmed means the machine has learnt. Once a computer program has learnt what to do with data it can do its work automatically.

\paragraph {Decision Tree}

\textcite{navada2011overview} defines a decision tree as tree structure where internal nodes represent tests (on input data patterns), and leaf nodes represent categories of those patterns. These tests are passed down through the tree to yield the correct output for the input pattern. Decision tree algorithms can be applied in various fields. They can replace statistical procedures to find data, extract text, identify missing data in a class, improve search engines, and are even used in medical applications. Many decision tree algorithms have been developed, each varying in accuracy and cost-effectiveness. It is also important to choose the right algorithm for the task at hand.

Decision trees are classified as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Classification Tree: Applicated in probability and statistics.
    \item Regression Tree: Used in calculations for real estate. Determines one single predetermined outcome from different pieces of information
    \item Decision Tree Forests: Varied decision trees are created and then grouped together in order to accurately determine as to what will happen with a particular outcome.
\end{itemize}
